## 🤔 What is GuideMe?

Most AI tools **summarize pages** or **give you text instructions** you have to follow manually. GuideMe is different — it **actually highlights the exact buttons and links** you need to click, guiding you step-by-step through any workflow.

**The Problem:** You're learning Figma, Photoshop, or navigating a complex admin panel. You ask an AI "how do I do X?" and get a wall of text. Now you have to hunt through menus trying to match the instructions.

**GuideMe's Solution:** Ask your question, and GuideMe will:
1. Analyze the current page
2. Identify the exact elements to click
3. Highlight them one by one
4. Guide you through multi-page flows automatically
5. **Export to automation scripts** (Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium) for testing!

**No more hunting through menus. No more taking notes from YouTube tutorials.**

### 🤖 Bonus: Test Automation Made Easy

**Beyond just guiding users, GuideMe doubles as a test automation recorder!**

Manually record your clicks, export the guide, and instantly convert it into executable test scripts:
- **Puppeteer** (Node.js automation)
- **Playwright** (Cross-browser testing)
- **Selenium** (Python automation)

Perfect for QA engineers who need to create regression tests, or developers building CI/CD pipelines. See [AUTOMATION_EXPORT.md](AUTOMATION_EXPORT.md) for details.

## 🌟 What Makes This Different?

| Traditional AI | GuideMe |
|----------------|---------|
| "Click on File > Export > Export As..." | *Highlights the File menu for you* |
| You read, remember, search | Just follow the highlights |
| Text instructions | Visual guidance |
| One-time answer | Save and replay guides forever |

### Three Powerful Modes

1. **AI Mode** - Ask any question, AI analyzes the page and creates a guide on-the-fly
2. **Recording Mode** - Manually record your clicks step-by-step (perfect for automation export!)
3. **Replay Mode** - Replay saved guides without any AI calls (works offline!)

This helps:
- **Users** who just want to get things done
- **QA Engineers** who need to create automated test scripts
- **Developers/teams** who can create guides and tests for their users

---

## ⚠️ Honest Limitations

**This is not perfect.** It's a work in progress and can definitely be improved.

- Works best on well-structured pages with clear labels
- Dynamic content (dropdowns, modals) may need a page refresh
- AI responses can vary — use refresh if guidance seems off
- Complex workflows may need multiple guide sessions
- Currently **websites only** — desktop apps are a future goal

But even with these limitations, it's useful. Most AI tools don't even try to show you *where* to click — they just tell you.

## 🧠 The Hard Truth: Why This Problem is Difficult

**What you're seeing is one of the hardest unsolved problems in AI right now.**

### The Core Challenge

When you look at a webpage, you instantly know which "Code" button to click — the big green one, not the small tab in the header. **You can SEE it.**

But the AI receives only text:
```
gm-5: "Code" [button] (main)
gm-12: "Code" [link] (header)
```

It cannot see:
- Visual prominence (colors, size, position)
- Spatial relationships (what's next to what)
- UI patterns (that green usually means "action")
- Context from surrounding elements

**Humans pick the right element instantly because we have eyes. The AI is essentially blind, making educated guesses from text hints.**

### Who Else is Working on This?

This isn't an unexplored problem — some of the biggest AI companies are tackling it:

| Company | Product | Funding |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Adept.ai** | ACT-1 (AI that uses software) | $415M+ |
| **MultiOn** | Browser automation agent | $29M |
| **Anthropic** | Claude Computer Use | $8B+ |
| **OpenAI** | Operator (rumored) | $13B+ |

These companies have hundreds of engineers and billions in funding. **The fact that this is hard doesn't mean we shouldn't try — it means solving even part of it is meaningful.**

### What Would Make This Better

| Current Approach | What Could Help |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Text-only DOM | **Vision AI** (send screenshots to GPT-4V/Claude Vision) |
| Generic prompts | **Site-specific training** (learn GitHub, AWS, Figma patterns) |
| One-shot guessing | **Feedback loops** (learn from user corrections) |
| Stateless | **Memory** (remember what worked on this site) |

### A Call to Contributors 🚀

**This is genuinely hard — and that's exactly why it's exciting.**

Every improvement you make helps thousands of users. Some ideas:
- **Add vision AI support** — send screenshots alongside DOM
- **Improve element extraction** — better hints, better context
- **Create site-specific guides** — pre-built paths for common sites
- **Build feedback mechanisms** — let users correct wrong selections

The gap between "working demo" and "magical experience" is where the interesting engineering happens. If you're looking for an impactful open source project to contribute to — this is it.

## 🎯 Vision & Roadmap

**Where we are:** Browser extension for websites

**Where we're going:** Desktop application software (Adobe, Figma, Blender, etc.)

New software and websites emerge every day. People will always need help navigating them. Our goal is to be the universal "show me where to click" solution.

### Potential Future

- [ ] Community guide library (browse/search guides)
- [ ] Desktop app support (beyond browser)
- [ ] Guide recording (watch clicks, generate guide)
- [ ] Team/enterprise features
- [ ] Automation integration (use guides for automated workflows)

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Works best on well-structured pages with clear labels
- Dynamic content (dropdowns, modals) may require clicking refresh
- AI responses may vary — use refresh if guidance seems incorrect
- Some complex workflows may need multiple guide sessions
- **Currently websites only** — desktop apps are a future goal
- Press **Escape** to quickly stop any guide

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

**GuideMe takes privacy seriously.** Here's exactly what happens with your data:

### What We Collect

| Data | Where It Goes | Stored? |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Button/link text** (e.g., "Settings", "Save") | Sent to AI provider | No - discarded after response |
| **Element types** (button, link, dropdown) | Sent to AI provider | No |
| **Page title & URL** | Sent to AI provider | No |
| **Your question** | Sent to AI provider | No |

### What We Do NOT Collect

- ❌ **Form data** (passwords, credit cards, personal info)
- ❌ **Page content** (articles, emails, messages)
- ❌ **Cookies or session data**
- ❌ **Any data sent to us** - we have no servers!

### Where Data Goes

```
Your Browser → AI Provider (Gemini/OpenAI/Claude) → Your Browser
                    ↑
             That's it. No middleman.
```

- **API Key**: Stored locally in your browser only
- **Saved Guides**: Stored locally in your browser only  
- **No analytics, no tracking, no telemetry**
- **100% open source** - verify the code yourself

### AI Provider Privacy

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is my API key safe?**
> Yes! Stored only in your browser's local storage, sent only to your chosen AI provider.

**Q: Does GuideMe work offline?**
> Saved guides work offline! New guides require internet for AI.

**Q: Why did it highlight the wrong element?**
> AI isn't perfect. Click the refresh button to re-scan.

**Q: Can I share guides with my team?**
> Yes! Export as `.guideme` files and share them.

**Q: How is this different from other AI tools?**
> Most AI tools give you text instructions. GuideMe actually highlights the elements on screen — visual guidance, not just words.

**Q: Is it safe?**
Yes. We only extract button/link text (like "Settings", "Code", "Save") and element types. We do NOT read form fields, passwords, page content, or anything sensitive.

**Q: Where does data go?**
Directly to the AI provider YOU choose (Gemini, OpenAI, or Claude). We have no servers and collect nothing.

**Q: Can someone spy on my browsing?**
No. The extension only activates when you ask a question. Your API key and saved guides stay in YOUR browser's local storage.
