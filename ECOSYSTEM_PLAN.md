# GuideMe Ecosystem - Vision & Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision

**Current:** A browser extension that provides AI-powered step-by-step guidance for any website.

**Goal:** Expand to desktop application software (Adobe, Figma, Blender, etc.) - because new software and websites emerge every day, and people will always need help navigating them.
